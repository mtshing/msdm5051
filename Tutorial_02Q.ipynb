    "# 1. Recursive definition\n",
    "\n",
    "A good start to write a recursive function is to first write out a recursive definition of the operation you want to create. For example, the recursive definition of computing factorial of a number can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "n! = f(n) = \n",
    "\\begin{cases} \n",
    "1 & \\text{if }n = 0 \\\\\n",
    "n\\cdot f(n-1) & \\text{if } n>0\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In a well-written definition, you should always find these two elements:\n",
    "- **Anchor** = the stopping condition. E.g. the $n=0$ case above.\n",
    "- **Inductive steps** =  the steps to generate the next operation. E.g. the $n>0$ case above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Translation into codes becomes straightfoward after obtaining such definition. It can be written via either of these patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The `while` loop pattern:\n",
    "\n",

    "        return <output of stopping condition>\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "    <function>:\n",
    "        if NOT <stopping condition>:\n",
    "            <inductive step>\n",
    "        return <output of stopping condition>\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The `if-else` clause pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    <function>:\n",
    "        if <stopping condition>:\n",
    "            return <output of stopping condition>\n",
