    "\n",
    "- Each time *next()* is called, an item will be returned. The order of returning the item follows a certain sequence.\n",
    "- When there are no more item left in the sequence, *done()* will return `True`.\n",

    "Basically anything in Python that are collection-like are iterables. For example, strings, tuples, and lists can all be iterated because they are obviously containing items that follow a certain order; dictionary and set can also be iterated, although their iteration order are hidden behind the hashing. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, an iterator can be thought as an iterable with an additional position parameter - which tells you up to which position the items have been processed and those beyond have not. To convert an iterable into an iterator, we can use the `iter()` function. "

Problems occur when the items are hugh in size - for example when you are doing an image processing task of over 10000 images of a few MB - it is simply impossible to load them all in the memory at the same time.\n",
