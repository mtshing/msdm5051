    "## 2.4. Loop detection in linked list\n",
    "\n",
    "The fastest method for detecting whether a loop is formed in a linked list is by the [Floyd’s Cycle-Finding Algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-does-floyds-slow-and-fast-pointers-approach-work/). The idea is clever (can be proven by just a few lines of maths) and easy to implement - there are two \"node checkers\" (i.e. pointer in C++) tranverse the linked list simultaneously but at different speed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The slower checker - traverses 1 node per iteration\n",
    "- The faster checker - traverses 2 nodes per iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "The faster checker will loop back and catch up the slower node from behind if a loop exists in the linked list. Otherwise it can reach the end of the list and thus show this list has no loop. \n",
    "\n",
    "Try to code it yourself. Don't search for the solution. "
