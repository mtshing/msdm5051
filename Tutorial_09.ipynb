In lower level languages like C++, data types like `int` and `str` are sets of rules that tells the computer how to interpret a binary machine code. But in Python, the difference between data type and class is not very unclear - on one hand, you can write OOP-liked syntax for some built-in data type (E.g. check out the `int` class [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#additional-methods-on-integer-types)); On the other hand, defining a new class is equivalent to creating a user-defined data type.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Private** - only methods within the same class can access them. \n",
    "- **Protected** - only methods from the same class, or any subclass that are derived from this class (i.e. inheritance) can access them. \n",
    "- **Public** - Any function can access them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of access control gives convenience to abstraction and security to data. For example, in a `student` object, we expect the `id` of the student should never be edited after created.

However inheritance from multiple superclasses can lead to maintainance difficulty If we are adding/editing some methods of one superclass, we also have to go into other superclass of the same subclass to check if the new change can lead to new conflits. Therefore multiple inheritance is generally not recommended. \n",

    "\n",
    "Polymorphism is a fancy name that describe the concept: we would like to use the *same* interface to make carry out *different* operations, depending on what the data type the input is, i.e. **overloading the functions / operators of the interface**. As a example, the operator `+` can carry out addition to number, but can also do concatenation to strings. By overloading the operators in the programming language design can reduce the number of operators needed for different operation, and make the language more convenient to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "In OOP, the idea of polymorphism is applied to subclasses which are derived from the same superclass - **it could be convenient if we can use the same set of names of attributes and methods for all the subclasses**, even though the attributes and methods may carry similar but different values and functionalities. This kind of design principle is also called Liskov Substitution Principle.\n",
